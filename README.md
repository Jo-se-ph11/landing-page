# landing-page
Am super excited for completing this project. It has been my most interesting and challenging one.
I now understand flexbox to a reasonable extent as I used it all through this project.
The most challenging property to me was flex-wrap: wrap. When I understood it, my page did not get squeezed whenever I resized my browser.
